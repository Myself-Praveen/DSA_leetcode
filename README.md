## 📌 About

This repository is a personal archive and learning journal for solving Data Structures & Algorithms problems on LeetCode. Each solution is written in C++ and auto-synced directly from LeetCode submissions using **LeetSync**. Solutions span a wide variety of topics — from arrays and linked lists to trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **250+ problems** solved and growing
- ✅ Solutions organized by **problem ID** for instant lookup
- ✅ Written in **C++** using standard STL
- ✅ **Auto-synced** from LeetCode via LeetSync — no manual uploads
- ✅ Flat, no-nonsense folder structure — one problem, one folder

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each problem lives in its own top-level folder named by ID and title:

```
DSA_leetcode/
├── 1-two-sum/
│   └── solution.cpp
├── 20-valid-parentheses/
│   └── solution.cpp
├── 102-binary-tree-level-order-traversal/
│   └── solution.cpp
├── 712-minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings/
│   └── solution.cpp
└── ...
```

**Naming convention:** `{problem-id}-{problem-title-in-kebab-case}/`

There are no sub-folders by difficulty or topic — just a flat list sorted by problem ID. Use Ctrl+F on GitHub or your file explorer to search by ID or keyword.

## 📚 A Note on Learning DSA

Data Structures and Algorithms are the foundation of writing efficient, scalable software. This repository isn't just a dump of accepted submissions — it's a record of building genuine problem-solving intuition: recognizing patterns, picking the right data structure, and reasoning carefully about time and space complexity.

Every problem here represents a real effort to understand *why* a solution works, not just *that* it works. If you're on the same journey, feel free to explore and learn alongside.
